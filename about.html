    <p>As one would expect from its name, the Gold Coast is a ritzy neighborhood filled with high-end shopping, beautiful old mansions on quiet tree-lined streets, and, of course, lots of white tablecloth restaurants. But while, yes, there’s a lot of high-end dining here suitable for special occasions — classic Chicago steakhouses, elegant French and Italian joints, farm to table spots where the menus change seasonally, and an Edenic oasis from a celebrated sommelier — there’s also pizza, Guinness, and a pair of the city’s loveliest cafes perfect for perching with a laptop all day long.
